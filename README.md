# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### With our knowledge in Python we will help PyBer analyze all the data creating different reports and graphs to assists them with what they need.

## Purpose 
### We will analyze the datasets provided by PyBer to find out on how the performance of the ride-share fluctuates in each city type and how can this factors be used to improve.

## Result
### After taking a careful look at the PyBer_summary_df we can confirm that the Urban cities have much more rides and drivers generating more fares then the other types of cities. 
### Total rides Urban 1625 > Suburban 625 > Rural 125 
### Total Drivers Urban 2405 > Suburban 490 > Rural 78.
### Total Fares Urban $39,854.38 > Suburban $19,356.33 > Rural $4,327.93 
### On the other hand the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver is lower than the Rural and Suburban cities.
### Average Fare per Ride Rural $34.62 > Urban $24.53 
### Average Fare per Driver Rural $55.49 > $16.57

## Summary

### 1. Urban cities should be the main focus of growth of the company.
### 2. Create promotions for the higher fares areas to atract more people to use the PyBer app.
### 3. Offer atractive benefits for drivers in the rural and suburban cities.
